             Mendeley is changing its
        API. In order to keep using Mendeley with BibBase past April
        14th, you need to:
             <ol>
              <li>
               renew the authorization for BibBase on Mendeley, and
              </li>
              <li>
               update the BibBase URL
            in your page the same way you did when you initially set up
            this page.
              </li>
